<body><h3>List Directories</h3>
<p>Show directories list on the USB media. <br/>When you press the list directory button, the selectable directories are displayed. Tap on the directory you want to choose and then on the “Select” button. To recurse through subdirectories, tap the directory name. </p>
<h3>Add keywords</h3>
<p>%YEAR%, %MONTH%, %DAY% and %DAY-OF-YEAR% can be used as target directory names. The keywords are converted into the year, month, and day on which the sync started.</p>
<p><strong>These options are displayed only when the sync type is Copy/Move.</strong></p>
<h3>Append the photo/video shooting time/date to the directory name</h3>
<p>If checked, the EXIF data of the backed up media is used to get the shooting date and time. The shooting timestamp is used and appended to the target folder. When the app is unable to get the shooting time from the EXIF, it uses the last modified time of the file.</p>
<h3>Directory</h3>
<p>Please enter the target or master directory. If you specify a directory that does not exist in the target, it will be created during synchronization.</p>
<h3>Select USB media</h3>
<p>Select the USB media root directory to get access to the USB storage. If you cannot select it, please send the system information to the developer with &quot;Menu -&gt; System Info&quot;.</p>
<p>USB media cannot be used unless there is a mount point (exp. /storage/0123-0123, etc.) corresponding to the USB media UUID.</p>
<p><strong>The following options are displayed only when the sync type is Archive.</strong></p>
<h3>If the date and time cannot be determined by EXIF data, display a confirmation message.</h3>
<p>If checked, when the shooting date and time cannot be acquired from EXIF , a confirmation message is displayed as to whether or not use the last modified time of the file instead. If you select Cancel in the confirmation dialog, the file will not be archived.</p>
<h3>Archive files if…</h3>
<p>Choose the time criteria to determine which files to archive. Time selection is based on the photo/video shooting date, or the last modified time if it is not possible to acquire the timestamp from the EXIF header.</p>

</ol>
<h3>Change the name of the file before archiving it in the target folder. </h3>
<p>If checked, the file name of the archived file will be changed based on your selected criteria. You can append the date and time in the file name &quot;File name template&quot;.</p>
<h3>File name template</h3>

<body><h3>Mount point</h3>
<p>Select mount point for internal storage.</p>
<h3>List Directories</h3>
<p>Show directories list on the internal storage. <br/>When you press the list directory button, the selectable directories are displayed. Tap on the directory you want to choose and then on the “Select” button. To recurse through subdirectories, tap the directory name.</p>
<h3>Directory</h3>
<p>Please enter the target or master directory. If you specify a directory that does not exist in the target, it will be created during synchronization.</p>
<h3>Add keywords</h3>
<p>%YEAR%, %MONTH%, %DAY% and %DAY-OF-YEAR% can be used as target directory names. The keywords are converted into the year, month, and day on which the sync started.</p>
<p><strong>These options are displayed only when the sync type is Copy/Move.</strong></p>
<h3>Append the photo/video shooting time/date to the directory name</h3>
<p>If checked, the EXIF data of the backed up media is used to get the shooting date and time. The shooting timestamp is used and appended to the target folder. When the app is unable to get the shooting time from the EXIF, it uses the last modified time of the file.</p>
<p><strong>The following options are displayed only when the sync type is Archive.</strong></p>
<h3>If the date and time cannot be determined by EXIF data, display a confirmation message.</h3>
<p>If checked, when the shooting date and time cannot be acquired from EXIF , a confirmation message is displayed as to whether or not use the last modified time of the file instead. If you select Cancel in the confirmation dialog, the file will not be archived.</p>
<h3>Archive files if…</h3>
<p>Choose the time criteria to determine which files to archive. Time selection is based on the photo/video shooting date, or the last modified time if it is not possible to acquire the timestamp from the EXIF header.</p>
<h3>Any date (all)</h3>
<p>Archive all pictures/videos</p>
<h3>Older than 7 days</h3>
<p>Archive only files with a shooting date older than the current time by 7 days or more</p>
<h3>Older than 30 days</h3>

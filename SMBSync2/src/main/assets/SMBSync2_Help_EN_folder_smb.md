### Append the photo/video shooting time/date to the directory name<br>

**These options are displayed only when the sync type is Copy/Move.**<br>
If checked, the EXIF data of the backed up media is used to get the shooting date and time. The shooting timestamp is used and appended to the target folder. When the app is unable to get the shooting time from the EXIF, it uses the last modified time of the file.<br>

**<u>The following options are displayed only when the sync type is Archive.</u>**<br>

### If the date and time cannot be determined by EXIF data, display a confirmation message.<br>

If checked, when the shooting date and time cannot be acquired from EXIF , a confirmation message is displayed as to whether or not use the last modified time of the file instead. If you select Cancel in the confirmation dialog, the file will not be archived.<br>

### Archive files ifâ€¦<br>

Choose the time criteria to determine which files to archive. Time selection is based on the photo/video shooting date, or the last modified time if it is not possible to acquire the timestamp from the EXIF header.<br>

- Any date (all)<br>
Archive all pictures/videos<br>
- Older than 7 days<br>
Archive only files with a shooting date older than the current time by 7 days or more<br>
- Older than 30 days<br>

### Increment file names by appending<br>

Add an order number to the file name when archiving.<br>

- Do not change<br>
Do not append a sequence number<br>

Append 01-99<br>
- 3 digits sequence<br>
Append 001-999<br>
- 4 digits sequence<br>
 Append 0001-9999<br>
